# Hello! 👋

🤚 My name is **Anggun Sulis Setyawan** a.k.a [@_bangsuwan](https://instagram.com/_bangsuwan/).<br>

🌱 I’m currently learning about data science and machine learning.<br>

🤟 Passionate about applying data science and machine learning to support environmental sustainability and develop tech-based solutions with measurable impact.<br>
---
With a background in Environmental Science, I have built a strong foundation through several academic and independent projects in Big Data Management and Analytics, Design Thinking, and Machine Learning/AI Development. I aim to contribute as a solutions-driven professional who connects technology and sustainability through data-driven innovation. 

I'm currently initiating ADEM (AI Development for better Environmental Management) -- a community for those who want to explore and develop AI, Data Science, and Big Data applications for environmental sustainability. If you share the same passion, 🌎 let's connect and create meaningful impact together!🚀 

I'm also open to opportunities in data analytics, machine learning, or data science roles where I can contribute to developing measurable, data-supported solutions that align with both organizational and sustainability goals.
