# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤š My name is **Anggun Sulis Setyawan**.<br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data science and machine learning.<br> 

ðŸ¤Ÿ I'm passionate about learning about data science applications for environmental issues around the world especially waste management issues in Indonesia. Interestingly, information technology (i.e. IoT, etc) can help us to make the right decision (solution) to save our home (the earth).<br> 

ðŸš€ My big vision is to build a green-tech company that will align economic, social, and environmental aspects with the technology ecosystem in Indonesia. The mission is to facilitate people to live better. Hence, I need lots of superpartners to gain the big goal. If you have any interest in collaboration, [feel free to connect to my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anggun-sulis-setyawan/)
